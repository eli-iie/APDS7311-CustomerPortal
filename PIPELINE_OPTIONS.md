# ðŸ§ª Alternative: Test Basic Pipeline First

If you want to confirm the build-and-test job works perfectly before setting up SonarCloud, I can:

## Option A: Temporarily Remove SonarCloud Job

```yaml
# Remove sonarcloud-analysis job and context requirement
# Keep only build-and-test job
# This should result in successful pipeline
```

## Option B: Complete SonarCloud Setup (Recommended)

Since we're so close, it's probably better to just complete the SonarCloud setup with the token.

**Which would you prefer?**
1. **Complete SonarCloud setup** (3 minutes - recommended)
2. **Test basic pipeline first** (temporary removal of SonarCloud)
