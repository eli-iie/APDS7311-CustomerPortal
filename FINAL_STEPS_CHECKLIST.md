# Final Submission Checklist

This checklist will guide you through the final steps needed to complete your APDS7311 Assignment submission with the CircleCI and SonarCloud integration.

## Step 1: Final CircleCI Pipeline Execution

1. Run the test-ci-integration.ps1 script to trigger a final CircleCI pipeline run:
   ```powershell
   .\test-ci-integration.ps1
   ```
2. Follow the prompts to enter your GitHub username and push changes to your repository.
3. Wait for the CircleCI pipeline to run and complete.

## Step 2: Verify SonarCloud Analysis Results

1. Visit your SonarCloud dashboard: https://sonarcloud.io
2. Check that the latest analysis includes:
   - Security hotspots detection
   - Code smells analysis
   - Overall quality gate status
3. Take screenshots of the SonarCloud dashboard showing the analysis results.

## Step 3: Run Final Cleanup Script

1. Run the cleanup script to remove unnecessary files:
   ```powershell
   .\cleanup_for_submission.ps1
   ```
2. When prompted, type "YES" to confirm the cleanup action.
3. Verify that only the required files remain in your project.

## Step 4: Create Demonstration Video

1. Record a video demonstration following the VIDEO_SCRIPT.md guidelines.
2. Make sure to show:
   - CircleCI pipeline execution
   - SonarCloud analysis results focusing on hotspots and code smells
   - How the security features work in the application

## Step 5: Final Repository Check

1. Ensure all required documentation is present:
   - README.md
   - CIRCLECI_SETUP.md
   - SONARCLOUD_ANALYSIS.md
   - VERIFY_CI_INTEGRATION.md
   - ASSIGNMENT_REQUIREMENT_COMPLETION.md
2. Verify no sensitive information (passwords, tokens) is exposed in the code.
3. Check that the .circleci/config.yml file is correctly formatted.

## Step 6: Submit Assignment

1. Package your project according to assignment requirements.
2. Include link to GitHub repository.
3. Include demonstration video.
4. Complete any required submission forms.
