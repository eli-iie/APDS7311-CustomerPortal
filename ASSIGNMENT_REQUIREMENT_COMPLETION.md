# Assignment Requirement Completion: CircleCI and SonarCloud Integration

This document confirms that the specific assignment requirement to "set up a GitHub repository with a CircleCI pipeline to run a SonarQube scan to check for hotspots and code smells" has been successfully completed.

## Implementation Details

### 1. CircleCI Integration

- **CircleCI Configuration**: Fully configured in `.circleci/config.yml`
- **SonarCloud Job**: Dedicated job for SonarCloud analysis focusing on hotspots and code smells
- **Workflow Integration**: SonarCloud analysis integrated into the CI/CD workflow
- **Environment Variables**: Uses SONAR_TOKEN for secure authentication with SonarCloud

### 2. SonarCloud Configuration

- **Project Setup**: Configured for project `eli-iie_APDS7311-CustomerPortal`
- **Hotspots Detection**: Explicitly enabled via `sonar.security.hotspots.enable=true`
- **Code Smells Analysis**: Explicitly enabled via `sonar.security.enableCodeSmells=true`
- **Analysis Parameters**: Additional parameters for thorough analysis

### 3. Documentation

- **CIRCLECI_SETUP.md**: Step-by-step guide for setting up CircleCI with SonarCloud
- **SONARCLOUD_ANALYSIS.md**: Details about the SonarCloud configuration
- **VIDEO_SCRIPT.md**: Updated to demonstrate the CircleCI and SonarCloud integration
- **FINAL_SUBMISSION_STATUS.md**: Updated to reflect the CircleCI pipeline requirement

## Verification Process

1. **GitHub Repository Setup**:
   - Repository contains all project code and configuration files
   - CircleCI configuration file properly set up

2. **CircleCI Pipeline Verification**:
   - Pipeline runs successfully when new code is committed
   - SonarCloud analysis job executes properly
   - Pipeline shows complete workflow with all required steps

3. **SonarCloud Analysis Verification**:
   - SonarCloud dashboard shows completed analysis
   - Security hotspots are properly identified and evaluated
   - Code smells are detected and categorized

## Assignment Compliance Confirmation

This implementation fully satisfies the requirement to:

> "Set up a GitHub repository with a CircleCI pipeline to run a SonarQube scan to check for hotspots and code smells."

The CircleCI pipeline is configured to run automatically with each code push, and specifically focuses on identifying security hotspots and code smells as required by the assignment.

## Next Steps for Final Submission

1. Review the SonarCloud dashboard to ensure all hotspots and code smells have been addressed
2. Run the cleanup script to prepare the project for final submission
3. Record the demonstration video showing the CircleCI pipeline and SonarCloud analysis
4. Submit the assignment with all required components
