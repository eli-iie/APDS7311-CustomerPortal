- Technical debt analysis
- Quality gate enforcement
- Test coverage monitoring

**[Show SonarCloud project dashboard]**
"The SonarCloud project is set up with the organization 'eli-iie' and project key 'eli-iie_APDS7311-CustomerPortal'. This provides automated analysis of code quality, security hotspots, and maintainability metrics."

**[Show SonarCloud Analysis Method settings]**
"In the SonarCloud administration panel, I've enabled Automatic Analysis to scan the repository on every commit. This ensures continuous monitoring of code quality and security vulnerabilities."

**[Show CircleCI integration]**
"SonarCloud integrates seamlessly with our CircleCI pipeline, providing automated quality checks on every commit to ensure code meets enterprise standards."
