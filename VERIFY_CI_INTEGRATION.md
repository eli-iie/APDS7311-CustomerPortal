# Verifying CircleCI and SonarCloud Integration

Use this guide to verify that your CircleCI pipeline with SonarCloud analysis is working correctly.

## Step 1: Push Code to GitHub

Use the `test-ci-integration.ps1` script to push changes to your GitHub repository, which will trigger the CircleCI pipeline.

## Step 2: Check CircleCI Pipeline Status

1. Visit your CircleCI dashboard: [https://app.circleci.com/pipelines](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines)
2. Find your `APDS7311-CustomerPortal` project
3. Look for the most recent pipeline run
4. Check the status of the pipeline:
   - "Running" means the pipeline is currently executing
   - "Success" means the pipeline completed successfully
   - "Failed" means there was an error in the pipeline

## Step 3: Verify SonarCloud Analysis Job

1. Click on the pipeline run to see the individual jobs
2. Find the `sonarcloud-analysis` job
3. Click on the job to see details
4. Check the job output for:
   - Successful installation of SonarCloud Scanner
   - Successful execution of SonarCloud analysis
   - Any error messages if analysis failed

## Step 4: Check SonarCloud Dashboard

1. Visit your SonarCloud dashboard: [https://sonarcloud.io](https://sonarcloud.io)
2. Find your `eli-iie_APDS7311-CustomerPortal` project
3. Verify that a new analysis has been completed
4. Check the analysis results for:
   - Security hotspots (as required by assignment)
   - Code smells (as required by assignment)
   - Overall quality gate status

## Step 5: Troubleshooting Common Issues

### CircleCI Pipeline Not Triggering:
- Verify that CircleCI is properly connected to your GitHub repository
- Check that your `.circleci/config.yml` file is valid
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions on both GitHub and CircleCI

### SonarCloud Analysis Failing:
- Verify that the `SONAR_TOKEN` is correctly set in CircleCI project settings
- Check that the token has not expired or been revoked
- Ensure your SonarCloud organization and project are set up correctly

### Token Authentication Issues:
- Generate a new SonarCloud token if needed
- Update the token in CircleCI environment variables
- Make sure the token has the necessary permissions

## Successful Integration Confirmation

When the integration is working correctly, you will see:

1. A green checkmark for your CircleCI pipeline
2. A completed SonarCloud analysis in your SonarCloud dashboard
3. Detailed results for security hotspots and code smells

This confirms that your project meets the assignment requirement to "set up a GitHub repository with a CircleCI pipeline to run a SonarQube scan to check for hotspots and code smells."
