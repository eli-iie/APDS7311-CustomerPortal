# 🎯 YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE! 

## Current Location: ✅ CircleCI → Organization Settings → Orbs

You're viewing the Orbs configuration page, which is correct! However, you need a different setting.

## 🔍 **LOOK FOR THIS SETTING ON THE SAME PAGE:**

**What you need to find:**
- **"Allow Uncertified Orbs"** (checkbox or toggle)
- **"Orb Security Settings"** section
- **"Third-party orbs"** settings

## 📍 **If you don't see it on this page:**

1. **Try going to**: Organization Settings → **Security** (instead of Orbs)
2. **Look for**: "Orb Security Settings" section
3. **Find**: "Allow Uncertified Orbs" checkbox
4. **Enable it** and **Save**

## 🔍 **Alternative Navigation:**
Sometimes the setting is under:
- **Organization Settings** → **Security** → **Orb Security Settings**
- Look for a section about "Third-party orbs" or "Uncertified orbs"

## ✅ **What the Setting Should Say:**
```
☐ Allow Uncertified Orbs
   Enable the use of uncertified orbs in your organization
```

**Check this box** and **Save**!

## 🚀 **After Enabling:**
- Your pipeline will immediately work
- SonarCloud orb will be authorized
- Both build-and-test + sonarcloud-analysis jobs will run

---
**You're very close! Look for "Allow Uncertified Orbs" on this page or under Security settings.**
