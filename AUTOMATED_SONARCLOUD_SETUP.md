# Automated SonarCloud Analysis Setup

This document summarizes the changes made to implement automated SonarCloud analysis via GitHub Actions.

## Changes Made

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow Created
- Created `.github/workflows/sonarcloud.yml` workflow file
- Set up automated analysis on push to main/master branches
- Added configuration for Node.js environment and dependency installation
- Configured test coverage collection

### 2. Documentation Updated
- Updated `README.md` to reflect GitHub Actions integration
- Updated `FINAL_SUBMISSION_STATUS.md` to include automated SonarCloud analysis
- Updated `VIDEO_SCRIPT.md` to demonstrate the GitHub Actions integration
- Created detailed `GITHUB_SETUP.md` guide for repository configuration
- Enhanced `SONARCLOUD_ANALYSIS.md` with automated setup information

### 3. Cleanup Script Modified
- Modified `cleanup_for_submission.ps1` to preserve GitHub Actions workflow files
- Kept `GITHUB_SETUP.md` as essential documentation
- Added removal of redundant component files (e.g., `EmployeeDashboard_fixed.js`)

## Next Steps

1. **Create GitHub Repository**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub named `APDS7311-CustomerPortal`
   - Follow steps in `GITHUB_SETUP.md`

2. **Push Code to GitHub**
   - Push your code to the newly created repository

3. **Set Up SonarCloud Integration**
   - Create a SonarCloud account and connect it to your GitHub account
   - Set up SonarCloud project using the same organization and project key as in `sonar-project.properties`
   - Generate SONAR_TOKEN and add it to GitHub repository secrets

4. **Verify Automated Analysis**
   - Make a small commit to trigger the workflow
   - Check GitHub Actions tab to verify workflow execution
   - Review SonarCloud dashboard for analysis results

## Benefits

- **Continuous Code Quality**: Every commit automatically triggers analysis
- **Security Monitoring**: Continuous security vulnerability scanning
- **DevSecOps Integration**: Seamless integration of security in development workflow
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated quality gates ensure code meets standards
- **Documentation**: Complete setup allows for future expansion of pipeline
