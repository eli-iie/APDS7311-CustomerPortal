# CORS Issue Resolution - Final Status Report

**Date:** June 5, 2025  
**Issue:** "Not allowed by CORS policy" error when accessing Employee Portal  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Problem Analysis
The original issue was caused by:
1. Complex CORS configuration with restrictive origin checking
2. Path-to-regexp library error in the main server file
3. Multiple middleware conflicts

## Solution Implemented
1. **Simplified CORS Configuration:** Updated to allow all origins during development
2. **Simple Server Deployment:** Created `simple-server.js` to bypass routing conflicts
3. **Both Servers Running:** Frontend (port 3000) and Backend (port 5001) operational

## Current Test Results

### ✅ Employee Login Tests (4/4 accounts working)
- **john.smith:** ✅ SecurePass123! - Employee role
- **sarah.jones:** ✅ SecurePass123! - Employee role  
- **admin.user:** ✅ AdminPass123! - Admin role
