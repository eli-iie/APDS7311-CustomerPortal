# 🛠️ YAML Issue Resolution - June 7, 2025

## ❌ Problem Identified: YAML Formatting Errors

Pipeline builds #62 and #63 failed with the error:
```
Unable to parse YAML while constructing a mapping in 'string', line 39, column 11:
  name: Security Audit
^
```

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

Two YAML formatting issues were identified:

1. **Missing Line Break**: No newline between the end of the Security Audit step and the beginning of the Code Quality Check step
   ```yaml
   npm audit --audit-level high || echo "Client audit completed with warnings"      - run:
   ```

2. **Missing Space**: No space between text and command in Security Audit section
   ```yaml
   echo "Running security audits..."            cd server
   ```

## ✅ Solution Implemented

Fixed both issues by:

1. Adding proper line break after client audit step
2. Adding proper space and formatting in Security Audit command

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

YAML is extremely sensitive to spacing and formatting. Common issues include:

1. **Missing Line Breaks**: Each step must be clearly separated
2. **Inconsistent Indentation**: Maintain the same indent level for similar items
3. **Mixed Spaces/Tabs**: Stick to spaces only, as YAML doesn't handle tabs well
4. **Command Formatting**: Multi-line commands need proper spacing

## 🚀 How to Prevent Future YAML Issues

1. **Use a YAML Validator**: Before committing, validate YAML with an online tool
2. **Consistent Style**: Maintain the same style throughout the file
3. **Visual Inspection**: Look for unaligned items that might indicate formatting issues
4. **Incremental Changes**: Make small changes and test after each one
