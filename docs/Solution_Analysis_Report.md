- Visual representation of security measures

### 1.2 Security Testing Tools ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
**Requirement**: Download, configure, and test MobSF and ScoutSuite
**Current Status**: No evidence of tool integration
**Gap**: Security testing tools not implemented

**Missing Components**:
- MobSF configuration and mobile app analysis

## 2. Task 2: Secure Customer Portal Development [52/80 Marks]

### 2.1 Customer Registration and Authentication ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** (15/15 points)

**✅ Strengths**:
- Password hashing with bcrypt (salt rounds = 12) ✅
- RegEx input validation for all fields ✅
- Strong password policy enforcement ✅
- Proper input sanitization ✅

```javascript
// Current implementation includes:
const passwordRegex = /^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,}$/;
const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(12);
```

### 2.2 International Payment Functionality ✅ **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED** (12/15 points)

**✅ Strengths**:

- Verifying payment details
- Validating SWIFT codes
- Submitting verified payments to SWIFT
- Pre-registered employee access (no registration needed)

**Current Status**: No employee portal exists

#### 2.4.4 Attack Prevention ✅ **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED** (8/10 points)
- **Session Hijacking**: Partial (JWT tokens) ✅
- **SQL Injection**: Protected (Mongoose ODM) ✅
- **Rate Limiting**: Basic implementation ✅
- **CSRF Protection**: Missing ❌
- **Clickjacking Protection**: Missing (no X-Frame-Options) ❌
- **XSS Protection**: Missing (no CSP headers) ❌

## 3. Detailed Security Gaps Analysis

### 3.1 Critical Security Issues ❌

#### 3.1.1 HTTPS/TLS Implementation
**Status**: Not implemented
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL
**Issue**: All traffic currently served over HTTP
**Required**: SSL/TLS 1.3 implementation

#### 3.1.2 Security Headers
**Status**: Partially implemented
**Risk Level**: HIGH
**Missing Headers**:
```javascript
// Required but missing:
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      frameAncestors: ["'none'"]  // Clickjacking protection
    }
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true
  }
}));
```

#### 3.1.3 Session Management
**Status**: Basic implementation
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
**Gaps**:
- No secure cookie flags
- No session timeout implementation
- Missing httpOnly cookies

### 3.2 Missing Employee Portal Features ❌

The assignment explicitly requires a separate employee portal with:
1. Pre-registered employee access
2. Payment verification interface
3. SWIFT code validation
4. "Submit to SWIFT" functionality
5. Audit trail capabilities

**Current Status**: Completely missing

### 3.3 Database Security Gaps

#### 3.3.1 Missing Employee Model
```javascript
// Required Employee model (missing):
const Employee = {
  employeeId: String,
  username: String,
  password: String, // hashed
  role: String,
  department: String,
  isActive: Boolean,
  lastLogin: Date
}
```

#### 3.3.2 Enhanced Payment Model Required
```javascript
// Current model missing fields:
const Payment = {
  // Missing fields:
  verifiedBy: ObjectId,      // Employee reference
  verifiedAt: Date,          // Verification timestamp
  submittedToSwift: Boolean, // SWIFT submission status
  submittedAt: Date,         // SWIFT submission time
  auditTrail: [AuditEntry]   // Action history
}
```

## 10. Conclusion and Next Steps

### Current Implementation Assessment
The existing solution demonstrates a solid foundation with good security practices for password handling and basic input validation. However, significant gaps exist in the employee portal functionality and comprehensive security implementation.

### Critical Missing Components (Must Implement)
1. **Employee Verification Portal** - 25% of total functionality
2. **Security Architecture Documentation** - Required for Task 1
3. **HTTPS/SSL Implementation** - Critical security requirement
4. **Security Testing Tools Integration** - MobSF and ScoutSuite

### Recommendations
1. **Prioritize Employee Portal Development** - This is the largest gap
2. **Implement HTTPS immediately** - Critical for production security
3. **Create security documentation** - Required for assignment completion
4. **Add comprehensive testing** - Both functional and security testing

### Success Metrics
- [ ] All functional requirements implemented (100%)
- [ ] All security requirements met (100%)
- [ ] Security testing tools integrated and reporting
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation completed
- [ ] Video demonstration showing complete workflow

**Estimated Additional Development Time**: 3-4 weeks for complete implementation
