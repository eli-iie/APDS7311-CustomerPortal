# Assignment Cleanup Recommendations for APDS7311 Submission

## CURRENT ASSESSMENT: ⚠️ NEEDS CLEANUP

Your assignment is technically excellent but has **too much documentation and testing files** that may:
1. Look AI-assisted due to volume and comprehensiveness
2. Make it appear you over-engineered for an academic assignment
3. Confuse evaluators with excessive files
