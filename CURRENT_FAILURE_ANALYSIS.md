# üîç Pipeline Failure Analysis - June 7, 2025

## üìä **UPDATED STATUS: Progress Made!**

### **BREAKTHROUGH: Orb Authorization Working!**
- **Previous failures** (immediate): "Orb not loaded" - 0s duration
- **New failures** (46-49s duration): Different issue - orb is loading!

### **New Error Pattern Analysis:**

**Timeline:**
- **#58** (2m ago): Failed after 46s ‚ö†Ô∏è NEW ISSUE
- **#57** (3m ago): Failed after 49s ‚ö†Ô∏è NEW ISSUE  
- **#56** (8m ago): Failed immediately - orb not loaded (OLD ISSUE)

### **What 46-49s Duration Means:**
1. ‚úÖ **Orb Authorization**: Working (no immediate failure)
2. ‚úÖ **build-and-test Job**: Likely completing successfully (~40s)
3. ‚ùå **sonarcloud-analysis Job**: Failing (~5-10s into execution)

### **Most Likely New Issue:**
```
SONAR_TOKEN not found in environment
```

## üéØ **Next Steps:**

### 1. Confirm SonarCloud Context Setup
- **Required**: Create "SonarCloud" context in CircleCI
- **Required**: Add SONAR_TOKEN environment variable to that context

### 2. Alternative: Temporarily Remove SonarCloud Job
- Test if build-and-test job succeeds alone
- Add SonarCloud back after confirming token setup

## üöÄ **EXCELLENT PROGRESS:**
We've successfully fixed the orb authorization issue! Now we just need to complete the SonarCloud token configuration.
