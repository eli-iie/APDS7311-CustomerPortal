# 🔬 Pipeline Test Status - June 7, 2025

## ✅ **SETTINGS CONFIRMED CORRECT**

Looking at your screenshots:
1. **CircleCI Orb Security**: ✅ "Allow uncertified public orbs" is ENABLED
2. **All Security Settings**: ✅ Properly configured
3. **Organization Setup**: ✅ Complete

## 🧪 **TESTING THE FIX**

**Issue**: Previous pipelines (#54, #55, #56) still failed because they ran before the setting was enabled.

**Solution**: Triggered new pipeline (commit 365613d) to test the fix.

## 📊 **Expected Pipeline Timeline**

### Previous Failed Pipelines:
- **Pipeline #56**: ❌ Failed (4m ago) - "Orb not loaded" 
- **Pipeline #55**: ❌ Failed (9h ago) - Same issue
- **Pipeline #54**: ❌ Failed (9h ago) - Same issue

### Expected New Pipeline:
- **Pipeline #57**: 🔄 Testing now - Should succeed with orb authorization

## 🎯 **What Should Happen Now**

### If the Fix Works:
- ✅ **build-and-test** job completes successfully
- ✅ **sonarcloud-analysis** job starts (may fail if SONAR_TOKEN missing)
- ✅ No more "orb not loaded" errors

### If SonarCloud Token Missing:
- ✅ build-and-test succeeds
- ❌ sonarcloud-analysis fails with "SONAR_TOKEN not found"
- 📝 Need to set up SonarCloud context and token

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

**Why Previous Pipelines Failed**:
1. SonarCloud orb requires "Allow uncertified orbs" setting
2. Setting was disabled by default in your organization
3. Pipelines ran before you enabled the setting
4. Once enabled, new pipelines should work

**The Technical Setup Was Always Correct** - it was just an organization permission issue!
