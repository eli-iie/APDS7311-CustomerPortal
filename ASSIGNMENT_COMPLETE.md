# APDS7311 Assignment - COMPLETE & MINIMAL SETUP ✅

## Overview
Successfully created a minimal, requirement-focused DevSecOps pipeline for the APDS7311 Secure Customer International Payments Portal assignment, removing all unnecessary over-engineering.

## ✅ ASSIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS IMPLEMENTED

### Task 2: Customer Portal [80 Marks] ✅
1. **Password Security** ✅ - bcrypt hashing and salting implemented
2. **Input Whitelisting** ✅ - RegEx patterns for injection attack prevention
3. **SSL/HTTPS** ✅ - Valid certificates and secure traffic
4. **Attack Protection** ✅ - Express Brute, Helmet, security middleware
5. **DevSecOps Pipeline** ✅ - Basic pipeline configured and triggered

### Task 3: Employee Portal [80 Marks] ✅
1. **Password Security** ✅ - Applied to both portals (customer + employee)
2. **DevSecOps Pipeline** ✅ - **SAST, SCA, API Testing, SonarQube Analysis**
3. **Static Login** ✅ - Pre-configured accounts, NO registration possible
4. **Web App Functionality** ✅ - Customer portal → Employee portal flow working

## 🗑️ REMOVED UNNECESSARY ITEMS

### Files Cleaned Up:
- ❌ Complex documentation (20+ .md files)
- ❌ Test scripts and monitoring tools
- ❌ Over-engineered configurations
- ❌ SonarCloud (not required, switched to SonarQube)
- ❌ Complex security tools (retire.js, nsp, etc.)

### Dependencies Optimized:
- ✅ Kept only essential security packages
- ✅ Maintained core functionality requirements
- ✅ Removed development bloat

### Task 3 Requirements ✅
- [x] Password security for both portals
- [x] **SonarQube scan for hotspots and code smells** 
- [x] **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**
- [x] **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**
- [x] **API security testing**
- [x] Pre-configured employee accounts
- [x] No registration process
- [x] Customer→Employee portal workflow
